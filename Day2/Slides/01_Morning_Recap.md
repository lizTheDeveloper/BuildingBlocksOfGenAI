# Morning Recap - VAE Results Review

## Key Points for Opening (15 minutes)

- Welcome back to Day 2 of Building Blocks of Generative AI
- Quick review of what we covered in Day 1:
  - Generative vs. discriminative models
  - Neural network foundations
  - Latent space and representation learning
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

## VAE Results Discussion

- Let's look at some of the results from yesterday's VAE exercise
- Key components we implemented:
  - Encoder: Compresses input to latent space distribution
  - Sampling: The reparameterization trick for backpropagation
  - Decoder: Reconstructs input from latent space
  - Loss function: Reconstruction loss + KL divergence

## Code Snippet: VAE Reparameterization Trick

```python
def sampling(args):
    """
    Reparameterization trick: z = mean + std * epsilon
    where epsilon is a random normal tensor
    """
    z_mean, z_log_var = args
    batch = tf.shape(z_mean)[0]
    dim = tf.shape(z_mean)[1]
    epsilon = tf.keras.backend.random_normal(shape=(batch, dim))
    return z_mean + tf.exp(0.5 * z_log_var) * epsilon
```

## VAE Applications and Limitations

- Applications:
  - Image generation
  - Data augmentation
  - Anomaly detection
  - Drug discovery

- Limitations:
  - Blurry reconstructions
  - Limited ability to capture complex distributions
  - Mode collapse

## Transition to Today's Topics

- Today we'll move to more advanced generative models:
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Attention mechanisms
  - Transformers architecture

- Questions from yesterday before we continue?
