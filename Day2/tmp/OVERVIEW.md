## Using These Materials

These files are designed to be used in several ways:

1. **For Teaching Demonstrations**: The visualization and demo files can be used to illustrate key concepts in class.

2. **For Hands-On Exercises**: The exercise files provide scaffolding for students to implement critical components while learning the architectures.

3. **For Google Colab**: These Python files can be combined into Colab notebooks, importing the necessary components as needed.

4. **For Reference**: The solution files provide complete implementations for reference or for students who get stuck.

The exercises are designed to be instructive without being overwhelming, focusing on the key aspects of each architecture while providing enough scaffolding for success.
