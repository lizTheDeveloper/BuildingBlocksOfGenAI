# BuildingBlocksOfGenAI Day 2 Reorganization

This directory contains the reorganized content for Day 2 of the Building Blocks of Generative AI course. The content has been restructured to follow a more logical progression:

1. **Attention Mechanisms** (1_Attention)
2. **Transformers** (2_Transformers)
3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (3_LLMs)
4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** (4_GANs)

## Changes Made

1. **Reordered Directories**: The directory structure has been changed to reflect the natural progression from fundamental building blocks (attention mechanisms) to more complex architectures (transformers, LLMs, GANs).

2. **Refactored Attention Implementation**: Updated the attention mechanism implementation to focus on the 2017 "Attention Is All You Need" paper rather than the 2015 Bahdanau attention paper.

3. **Added New Content**:
   - `SimpleAttention.ipynb`: A beginner-friendly notebook with extremely detailed comments explaining attention mechanisms
   - `transformer_from_scratch_exercise.py`: A comprehensive exercise for building a transformer from scratch
   - `transformer_from_scratch_solution.py`: The solution to the transformer exercise
   - `transformer_visualization.py`: Tool for visualizing various components of the transformer architecture

## Next Steps

To finalize the reorganization:

1. **Verify Content**: Review the new files to ensure they meet your standards and correctly build on concepts from Day 1 (VAEs, feedforward neural networks, backpropagation, softmax).

2. **Execute Directory Changes**: The files are currently in the `/tmp` directory. Once you've verified the content, you can replace the original Day 2 directories with these reorganized versions.

3. **Update References**: Make sure any references to these files in other parts of the course (e.g., in Day 3 materials or exercises) point to the correct new locations.

4. **Create Google Colab Notebooks**: Consider converting the key Python files into Google Colab notebooks for easier student interaction, especially the `SimpleAttention.ipynb` file which is already in notebook format.

## Overview of Educational Approach

This reorganization follows a "building blocks" approach:

1. Students first learn about attention mechanisms, which are the fundamental innovation enabling modern language models
2. They then build up to transformers, which use these attention mechanisms in a specific architecture
3. Next, they understand how LLMs extend the transformer architecture for language tasks
4. Finally, they explore GANs as an alternative generative approach

This sequence allows students to understand the logical progression of innovations in generative AI and builds on the variational autoencoder concepts covered in Day 1.
