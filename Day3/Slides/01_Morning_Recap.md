# Morning Recap: Where We Are in Our Journey

## Day 2 Recap

- **GANs**: Generator and discriminator networks in adversarial training
- **LLMs**: Evolution from RNNs to Transformers
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Self-attention and multi-head attention
- **Transformers**: Architecture with attention, position encoding, and feed-forward networks

## Key Exercises from Day 2

- Implemented a GAN for MNIST generation
- Built basic attention mechanisms
- Constructed a transformer architecture from scratch

## Transition to Day 3

- From "building from scratch" to "leveraging pre-built models"
- From "how it works" to "how to apply it effectively"
- From "components" to "end-to-end applications"

## Today's Focus

1. **Using the Hugging Face ecosystem**
2. **Training and fine-tuning LLMs effectively**
3. **Applying transfer learning principles**
4. **Building real-world applications**

## What to Expect Today

- More hands-on exercises
- Working with state-of-the-art models
- Practical considerations and trade-offs
- Bringing everything together in a final project
